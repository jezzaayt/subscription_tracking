#  Subscription Tracker

I basically built this to learn tkinter see the differences between pack and grid within different windows of this app as well as  improve my SQL skills within Python dev. 

Just a small python app to track subscriptions in Twitch or other services. Twitch allows to put badges for when someone gifted a sub and by who and to what channel what badge currently have and how long subscribed to the channel for now. Twitch is enforced when the database is created for ability of autohiding some labels and text entries. Ability to create other services to list as well. 


Bar Graph for channel and how long subscribed to the service for, this required the total subscription to have digit inputted if not the entry will not display on the graph

**This does not connect to any website or login it is completely manual input.**

No intentions to ever connect this to an API. If I did, I would self-fork or rebuild from scratch.
